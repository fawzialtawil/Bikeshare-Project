### Project Title:
US Bikeshare Analysis Tool

### Description:
For this project, I used Python to study data about bike sharing in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to bring in the data and figure out useful information by doing some math. Also, I made a program that lets people type things in the computer to see interesting facts about the data.

### Files used:
- chicago.csv
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
